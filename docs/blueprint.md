# **App Name**: KanbanFlow

## Core Features:

- Kanban Board UI: Basic Kanban board display with Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Review, and Done columns. Utilizes drag-and-drop functionality for moving tickets between columns.
- Ticket Display: Display tickets in each column with essential details (title, description preview, tags). Tickets will support viewing with an activity log (each message).
- User Profiles: Enable users to create and manage user profiles. Profiles should display basic info such as email and assigned role.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7) for a modern, sophisticated feel that stands out on dark backgrounds.
- Background color: Dark gray (#303030) to create a dark-themed interface suitable for prolonged use.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#D8C2FF) to highlight interactive elements against the primary color.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) provides a modern, machined look and is suitable for both headlines and body text.  Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Prioritize a clean, card-based layout within the Kanban board. Columns are clearly delineated with space for ticket drag-and-drop functionality. Ensure consistency and legibility across different screen sizes.
- Subtle transitions are applied during ticket movements between columns. This could include a slight fade or smooth slide to visually confirm actions without causing distraction.
