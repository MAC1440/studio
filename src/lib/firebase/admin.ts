// The Admin SDK is powerful and should be used within specific, secure server-side environments like Cloud Functions or dedicated backend servers, not directly within Next.js API routes or Server Components in this project's architecture to avoid bundling issues.
// For actions requiring admin privileges, a Cloud Function callable via HTTPS is the recommended approach.
